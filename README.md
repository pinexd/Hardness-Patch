## What's this?
This is a mod for Minecraft Fabric 1.21.4 that allows users to edit the hardness of any block, using a config menu with Cloth Config API.
It's fairly simple, but it works just fine.

## Cloth Config Menu

It has it's issues, such as
1) The - button in the block list is nonfunctional
2) After pressing the + button and naming the block ID, you have to save and reopen the config in order to edit the hardness of the block.
3) Probably some janky code

#### Disclaimer
Several parts of this mod were developed with the use of AI. If you wish not to use the mod for that reason, I completely understand.
